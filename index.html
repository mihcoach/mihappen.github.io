  <h2>What is Coaching?</h2>
  <p>
    People have audacious goals but can struggle with a path or the accountability to get there.
    That's understandable- we're people! I meet you where you are and support you in obtaining
    your goals. From my everyday job to coaching on an individual basis, I'm about showing up
    and supporting people to reach their objectives. Simply put, you deserve to reach your
    ultimate goals, and I'm here to get you there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coaching is not therapy, consulting, mentoring, training, or sports coaching. It is a
    partnership between you and me. I will guide you in a thought-provoking and creative process
    and inspire you to maximize your personal and professional potential.
  </p>
  <p>
    Coaching isn't only for those big sticky situations, and it certainly doesn t only apply to
    when you're stuck. Cut through the noise, bring clarity to any situation, or learn more about
    yourself through coaching with me. Remember, I'm here to support your goals. Bring your agenda
    and let's get started.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Make It Happen Coaching, I partner with you to explore where you are now, where you want to be,
    and what might be holding you back. Together, we create practical strategies that support
    meaningful and lasting change.
