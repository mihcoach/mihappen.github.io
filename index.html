    <h2>What Is Coaching?</h2>
    <p>
      People have audacious goals but can struggle with a path or the accountability to get there.
      That's understandable- we're people! I meet you where you are and support you in obtaining your goals.
      From my everyday job to coaching on an individual basis, I'm about showing up and supporting people
      to reach their objectives. Simply put, you deserve to reach your ultimate goals, and I'm here to get you there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Coaching is not therapy, consulting, mentoring, training, or sports coaching. It is a partnership between
      you and me. I will guide you in a thought-provoking and creative process and inspire you to maximize your
      personal and professional potential.
    </p>

    <p>
      Coaching isn't only for those big sticky situations, and it certainly doesn t only apply to when you're stuck.
      Cut through the noise, bring clarity to any situation, or learn more about yourself through coaching with me.
      Remember, I'm here to support your goals. Bring your agenda and let's get started.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Make It Happen Coaching, I partner with you to explore where you are now, where you want
      to be, and what might be holding you back. Together, we create practical strategies that
      support meaningful and lasting change.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Meet Coach Jessica</h2>
    <p>
      I'm glad you're here. Taking the first steps into something like working on yourself can feel daunting
      and sometimes selfish - I get it. Here's the secret though, by taking these steps you become the best
      version of yourself. And when you're the best version of yourself, you thrive.
    </p>
    <p>Theré's never a one-size fits all solution in coaching. I believe everyone and every circumstance is
      unique: I'm empathetic to all facets of life. This has led me on my journey to where I am today - someone
      who likes to help. I meet people where they are and guide them on a forward path with a sense of clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't wait to get to know you and watch as you transform yourself through your journey. Let's make it happen!
